# Machine-Learning-Ng
Repo for ML course offered by Andrew Ng of Stanford on Coursera
All implementations are done in MATLAB.

## Example 1 Linear Regression

Includes an implementation of linear regression, it's cost function, and gradient descent.

## Example 2 Logistic Regression

Includes an implementation of logistic regression, regularized logistic regression, and advanced optimization functions.

## Example 3 Multi-Class Prediction

Includes two implementations of multi-class prediction.  
1. Logistic Regression  
2. Neural Networks (forward propagation)

## Example 4 Neural Networks

Includes an implementation of back propagation with gradient check to learn the parameters for a neural network.
