# Machine-Learning-Ng
Repo for ML course offered by Andrew Ng of Stanford on Coursera  
All implementations are done in MATLAB.

## Example 1 Linear Regression

Includes an implementation of linear regression, it's cost function, and gradient descent.

## Example 2 Logistic Regression

Includes an implementation of logistic regression, regularized logistic regression, and advanced optimization functions.

## Example 3 Multi-Class Prediction

Includes two implementations of multi-class prediction.  
1. Logistic Regression  
2. Neural Networks (forward propagation)

## Example 4 Neural Networks

Includes an implementation of back propagation with gradient check to learn the parameters for a neural network.

## Example 5 Bias/Variance trade-off

Using ridge regression, this programming exercise uses a learning curve to diagnose high-bias/high-variance problems. Then, cross-validation is used to fit the lambda parameter in the penalty term for ridge regression.  

## Example 6 Support Vector Machines

Implementation of SVM algorithm to classify spam emails. Includes an example of feature building for text data.  

## Example 7 Unsupervised Learning: K-means and PCA

Implementation of K-means clustering and Principal Components Analysis for image compression. Additionally, dimensionality reduction is used to visualize high-dimensional data.  

## Example 8 Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems

Implementation of anomaly detection to detect failing servers on a network. Also an implementation of collaborative filtering (low rank matrix factorization) to build a movie recommender system.
